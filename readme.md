# Opendata to SQLite

This is a quick repo I made that can use Socrata, used by [Chicago](https://data.cityofchicago.org/), [New York State](https://data.ny.gov/), etc, to download datasets since some datasets can't be done in one go, like [this one with 76.3 million rows](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Origin-Destination-Ridership-Estimate-2/jsu2-fbtj/about_data). 

This was written in Bun v1.1.29.

Config is at the top of `index.js`.
